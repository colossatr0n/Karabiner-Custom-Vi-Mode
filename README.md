# karabiner-custom-vi-mode
A custom Vi-Mode that can be used in the private.xml for Karabiner. Vi-Mode enables custom keys to be used only when a combination of keys (Vi-Mode) is pressed and held. The layout presented below is supposed to be as intuitive as possible.

This custom Vi-Mode is enabled when the user holds down S and D. The amount of keys held and the type of keys held to enable Vi-Mode can be easily changed. The keys that get modified when Vi-Mode is enable can also be easily changed.

While the user is holding down S and D, Vi-Mode enables the following:

Arrow Keys (Cursor Selection)
-----------------------------
J = LEFT ARROW KEY

L = RIGHT ARROW KEY

I = UP ARROW KEY

K = DOWN ARROW KEY

Jump Selection (Cursor)
-----------------------
H = OPTION + LEFT ARROW KEY (place cursor back an entire word)

; = OPTION + RIGHT ARROW KEY (place cursor forward an entire word)

Delete
----------------------
U = DELETE

Y = OPTION + DELETE (deletes entire word in Microsoft Word. Change to CNTRL+W to do this in Terminal)

Enter
-----------------------
O = ENTER

Once S and D are released, all the keys return to their normal unmodified state.
